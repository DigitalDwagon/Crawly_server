# Crawly Project: Server
The crawly project server is the home base and primary tracker for a distributed web crawling and indexing project. It runs on Java, using MongoDB as a database and SparkJava as a web server and API.

This code is published so that others can see and use it as an example or starting point - it's not currently in a state where it can be run on it's own without tweaks and modifications. If you think you can improve this issue (such as by adding configurability) or otherwise help the project by submitting code, I welcome all contributions.
